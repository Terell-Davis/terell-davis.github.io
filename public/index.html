          Hello! I'm Terell Bernard Davis, a dedicated Computer Engineering student on the brink of graduation from Georgia Southern University. My academic journey has been a blend of innovation, technology, and creativity, leading me towards specializing in a domain where precision meets passion.

          My fascination with technology extends beyond the classroom, diving into the realm of home networking and server hosting. From managing video game servers to running a media sharing website like Plex, each project is a new adventure. My curiosity didn't stop there; I ventured into the world of automation and found a drive that pushes me to streamline and innovate continually.

          When I'm not tangled in wires or coding away, I express myself through music, playing the guitar and saxophone. These hobbies not only provide a creative outlet but also balance my technical pursuits with melodious harmony.

          - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?
          - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward.
          Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
          - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.
          Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
          That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!
          - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!
