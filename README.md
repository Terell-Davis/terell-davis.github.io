# My Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and skills. This site is built with React and hosted at [https://www.terellbdavis.com](https://www.terellbdavis.com).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Terell-Davis/terell-davis.github.io.git
cd terell-davis.github.io
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project.
- `npm run predeploy`: Runs the build script to bundle the app.
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys the build to GitHub pages.

## Additional Notes

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Deployment is handled through `gh-pages`. Make sure to configure your repository settings on GitHub to serve the website from the `gh-pages` branch or the `build` folder in the main branch.
